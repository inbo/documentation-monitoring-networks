# Guidelines for Monitoring Networks
A logseq graph for dynamic guidelines and best practices regarding design and implementation of (ecological) monitoring programmes/networks.
(work in progress)

This is an attempt to create a more dynamic version of the ["Leidraad voor de meetnetontwerper" (Onkelinx *et al.*, 2008)](https://www.vlaanderen.be/publicaties/ontwerp-en-evaluatie-van-meetnetten-voor-het-milieu-en-natuurbeleid-leidraad-voor-de-meetnetontwerper).

- ## Usage
	- Good practice for usage has not been finally decided upon.
	- It is recommended to fork this repository for your own monitoring project, and start collecting information.
	- However, I recomment *keeping the "[[Phases]]" and "Questions" unchanged, since they are provided by the original repo and may be subject to change.
	- Step-by-step:
		- [fork this repo](https://docs.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
		- install logseq and connect to git ([video here / internal](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D58m2Tsow3GFOkgB4vWA0wfmPKe4RpUz?usp=drive_link))
		- create a dedicated [[about]] page for your project
		- inform and invite collaborators
	- The recommended git workflow is to collaboratively work on the main branch:
		- pull before you work
		- commit and push changes immediately
	- Helpers: you can use the logseq plugins "git" and "tags".
