# Guidelines for Monitoring Networks
A [logseq](https://logseq.com) graph for dynamic guidelines and best practices regarding design and implementation of (ecological) monitoring programmes/networks.
(work in progress)

To be forked and filled with life by the "Meetnet"-projects at [INBO](https://www.vlaanderen.be/inbo).

This is an attempt to create a more dynamic version of the ["Leidraad voor de meetnetontwerper" (Onkelinx *et al.*, 2008)](https://www.vlaanderen.be/publicaties/ontwerp-en-evaluatie-van-meetnetten-voor-het-milieu-en-natuurbeleid-leidraad-voor-de-meetnetontwerper).

# Usage
- Good practice for usage has not been finally decided upon.
- It is recommended to fork this repository for your own monitoring project, and start collecting information.
- However, I recomment *keeping the "[[Phases]]" and "Questions" unchanged, since they are provided by the original repo and may be subject to change.
- Step-by-step:
	- [fork this repo](https://docs.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
	- install logseq and connect to git ([video here / internal](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D58m2Tsow3GFOkgB4vWA0wfmPKe4RpUz?usp=drive_link))
	- create a dedicated [[about]] page for your project
	- inform and invite collaborators
- The recommended git workflow is to collaboratively work on the main branch:
	- pull before you work
	- commit and push changes immediately
    - This will occasionally lead to merge conflicts in journals, yet those are easily solved.
- Helpers: you can use the logseq plugins "git" and "tags".
